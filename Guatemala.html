         <h1>Guatemala/Safe Passage Experience</h1>
             <p>In the Spring of 2016 I heard about a non-profit group called "Safe Passage" that operates in Guatemala City but was founded in Maine in 1999.
             Their mission is to provide support, education, and opportunities to underprivileged families who live in one of the poorest neighborhoods in Latin America.
             I decided to spend two months volunteering there in order to experience a totally new culture and see firsthand the struggles of the community. I spent my time at their early childcare
             center, helping to feed and watch over the 2-4 year olds who stayed there. It was truly one of the most eye-opening experiences of my life
             thus far and I hope to one day return and see how Safe Passage has created a lasting impact in the community. If you want to learn more about Safe Passage
             and the work that it does, you should check out their website: <li><a href="https://www.safepassage.org">Safe Passage</a></li></p>
